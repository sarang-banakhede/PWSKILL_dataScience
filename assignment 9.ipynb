    "Question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. When an exception occurs, it typically means that the program has encountered an error or an unexpected condition that it cannot handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception occurs, Python creates an object representing the exception, which contains information about the error, such as its type and the location in the code where it occurred. This object is then passed up the call stack until it is handled by an appropriate exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in mechanism for handling exceptions, using the try...except statement. Code that might raise an exception is placed in a try block, and any code that should be executed in response to the exception is placed in an except block. When an exception occurs in the try block, Python will jump to the except block and execute the code there, rather than raising an error and stopping the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both exceptions and syntax errors are types of errors that can occur in a program, but they differ in their causes and how they are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error occurs when there is a mistake in the syntax of the code, such as a missing bracket, a misspelled keyword, or an incorrect indentation. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the compilation phase, before the program is run. When a syntax error occurs, Python will display a message indicating the location of the error and the type of syntax error that occurred, and the program will not run until the error is fixed. \n",
    "example:\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an exception is an error that occurs while the program is running, when a statement or function encounters an unexpected condition or situation. These conditions can be caused by many factors, such as invalid input, network failures, file errors, or memory problems. When an exception occurs, Python will create an exception object and raise it, causing the program to stop unless the exception is handled by an appropriate exception handler\n",

    "x = 5\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "z = x / y"

    "Question 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it will cause the program to terminate abruptly and display an error message that includes information about the exception, such as the type of the exception, the line of code where it occurred, and a traceback of the call stack.\n",
